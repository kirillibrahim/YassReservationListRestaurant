- At Yassir, restaurant owners are one of our services’ users. To help them manage their business better, you’ll be building an interface to display upcoming reservations, so that they can take action on them. As the API for this feature isn’t public, we’ve provided you with a set of mock reservations. You’re free to use whatever tools you’re comfortable working with, so you can focus on getting the important bits right.

- Scenario: Display the reservations as a list Given User is in the reservation list section Then List of reservations for upcoming days are displayed

- Scenario: Filter reservations Given User is in the reservation list section When User filters by date / status / shift / area Then List of reservations is updated based on the filters selected
- Scenario: Sort reservations Given User is in the reservation list section When User clicks on a field to sort Then List of reservations is updated based on the sorting applied

- Scenario: Search by name and surname Given User is in the reservation list section When User searches by name and surname of the reservation Then Displays the results for the specified name and surname in the list

* Non functional requirements The user is able to filter by: - Status (confirmed / seated / checked out / not confirmed) - Date (past and future dates) - Shifts (breakfast / lunch / dinner) - Area The user can sort by guest number and guest name
